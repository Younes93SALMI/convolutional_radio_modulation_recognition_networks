This repository reproduces the well-known VT-CNN2 model and others for **Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC)** using the RadioML 2016.10A dataset.

# Overview

Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is an important task in modern wireless communications, cognitive radio, and spectrum sensing.

VT-CNN2 was one of the first deep learning architectures demonstrating that raw IQ samples can outperform expert features for modulation recognition, particularly at low SNR.

The original paper proposed a shallow convolutional neural network operating directly on complex-valued IQ samples represented as two real-valued channels (I and Q).
